# PCB for Reworked Design
Prof. Block used EagleCAD to design the circuit board for the reworked design. The circuit schematic resembles my [reworked wiring diagram](https://github.com/monk200/Segbot/blob/main/Wiring/Initial%20Design%20Wiring%20Diagram.png), but my diagram only has the essential peripherials to make the Segbot work labeled. The board was fabricated at https://www.4pcb.com/ and my professor uses its [free file checker](https://www.4pcb.com/free-pcb-file-check/index.html).  

## Wiring Considerations
This board design is significantly more complex because the board was designed with the intent of using it for any number of personal projects. My initial design minimized complexity because I was focusing on the project at hand and I am less experienced than my Professor.
